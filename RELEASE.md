The next version of the UI for the Kaoto project.

## How to do a release
1. Update the version in all `package.json` files, f.i. `2.0.0`
2. Create a PR with the changes
3. After rebasing and merging the PR, trigger the Realese Workflow named `Release Pipeline, create a tag/release for Kaoto Next, publish the NPM and release a container image`. As the name implies, this Workflow will create the tag/release for the project. In addition to that, a new npm package will be published to the npm Package Registry and a new Docker image will be pushed to Quay.io.
